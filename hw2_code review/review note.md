2.API calls: Tweepy,ffmpeg,Google Vision

3.Code convention:

6.Is the main call Synchronous or Asynchronous:
Synchronous.Deesn't need additional inputs.

## Develop Test scenarios and scripts
The code can perfectly get image URL, download them, and convert them to a vedio/vedioes.
However, It appears credential problem when calling Google Vision.

Before I ran the code, in terminal, I exported Google applicaiton Credential of my own json file:
```
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/Users/rzhan/Desktop/Alzheimer\'s-683341b411e6.json"
```
Then I ran the code, after converting images into vedio, there came error shows that:
```
google.auth.exceptions.DefaultCredentialsError: File /Users/rzhan/Desktop/Alzheimer\'s-683341b411e6.json was not found.
```
So I just designed test for the first two steps.

I tried to give a wrong twitter ID in command line, and it returned error message like this

Then I gave an empty screen page, it showed following result

As no images are downloaded, FMPEG also raises error

Images above shows that the program handles error inputs very well!

Then I changed the twitter ID to @ladygaga, it works!(But also failed in calling Google Vision)
