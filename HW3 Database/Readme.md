## Configure Enivronment :smirk:
  For running the code, you need to download and install following packages:
  
  My Environment is **macOS High Sierra Version 10.13.3** and **Python 3.5**.
  
  MongoDB:
  https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/installation.html
```
  brew install mongodb
```
  
  pymongo-3.6.1
  https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/installation.html
```
  python -m pip install pymongo
```

  wget (v.3.2)
```
  pip install wget 
```

  google-cloud-vision(v.0.30.0)
```
  pip install google-cloud-vision
```

```
  pip install google-cloud-bigquery
```

Then set up a Cloud Platform Console project and **download a private key as JSON**

```
  export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="[PATH]"
```

Warm NOTE: If Google Cloud does not running on your compter successfully, you may try this command,
```
  source ~/.bashrc
```
Hope this helps. :neckbeard:

**Remember to Enable Google Cloud Vision API** in Google Cloud Console
